Fast track from ideas to live trading

# TODO:
1. Implement IBarSource for local history CSV (migrate from StockSharp.AdvancedBacktest)
2. Implement unit tests for core logic using mock data (don't make detailed coverage for performance metrics for now)
3. Create WebApi (with minimal API) and Application (with UseCases invoking Domain logic) projects
4. Analyze existing Debug Mode, what can be done better if re-created from scratch
